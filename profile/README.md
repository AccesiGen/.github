About Us
We are committed to making the digital world more inclusive and accessible for everyone, regardless of their abilities. Our AI-powered solutions integrate cutting-edge machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision models to remove barriers in web accessibility.

Our Mission
To enhance digital accessibility through AI-driven solutions that empower individuals with visual, cognitive, hearing, and motor impairments, ensuring equal access to online content.

Our Solutions
We develop innovative Chrome extensions and AI-based tools that provide:

AI-Powered Image Captioning â€“ Uses BLIP-2 to generate accurate and meaningful captions for images.
Text Simplification â€“ Converts complex text into an easy-to-read format using T5/GPT models.
Smart Accessibility Settings â€“ High contrast mode, grayscale mode, dyslexia-friendly fonts, and text resizing.
Read Page Aloud â€“ AI-driven Text-to-Speech (TTS) for content consumption.
Cursor Movement via Head & Eye Tracking â€“ Enables hands-free navigation using Mediapipe/WebGazer.js.
Real-Time Video-to-Sign Language Translation â€“ Uses Transformer + LSTM models to convert videos into sign language.
Pause Animations â€“ Helps users with ADHD and motion sensitivity by stopping unnecessary page animations.
Why Our Solution Stands Out
Unlike traditional accessibility tools, our AI-powered extension provides real-time accessibility enhancements, leveraging advanced deep learning models. This ensures a more interactive and adaptable web experience for users with disabilities.
