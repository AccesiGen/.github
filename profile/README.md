## 🚀 Our Solutions
We develop innovative **Chrome extensions** and **AI-based tools** that provide:

- **🖼️ AI-Powered Image Captioning** – Uses **BLIP-2** to generate accurate and meaningful captions for images.
- **📖 Text Simplification** – Converts complex text into an easy-to-read format using **T5/GPT models**.
- **🎨 Smart Accessibility Settings** – High contrast mode, grayscale mode, dyslexia-friendly fonts, and text resizing.
- **🔊 Read Page Aloud** – AI-driven **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** for content consumption.
- **🖱️ Cursor Movement via Head & Eye Tracking** – Enables hands-free navigation using **Mediapipe/WebGazer.js**.
- **🎥 Real-Time Video-to-Sign Language Translation** – Uses **Transformer + LSTM models** to convert videos into sign language.
- **⏸️ Pause Animations** – Helps users with ADHD and motion sensitivity by stopping unnecessary page animations.
